NAME
    holiday.sh - Return 0 if holiday, else non-zero

    Mainly for use in cron, to skip holidays. For example:

SYNOPSIS
            holiday.sh [-h] [-d YYYY-MM-DD] [-t HH] [-w TAG]

DESCRIPTION
    This script will read a file (default: /usr/local/etc/holidays.txt) to
    see if "today" (or the -d date) is a holiday.

    The -d option can be passed to see if that date is a holiday.

    There can be zero or more -w TAG flags.

OPTIONS
    -h  Print this help, then exit with a 1 return code.

    -d YYYY-MM-DD
        Pass in the date to test for holiday. Default: today

    -w TAG
        One or more TAGs words can be specified (using multiple -w options).
        This will activate any lines that contain the TAG words between []
        characters.

RETURN VALUE
    Return 0 if the date is a holiday, else non-zero

ERRORS
EXAMPLES
    Example cron job:

     cHolidayFile="/projects/mgmt4/data/tid-closed.txt /projects/mgmt4/data/tid-holidays.txt"

     # M H d m w  user
     5 * * * *  root  /usr/local/bin/holiday.sh || /usr/local/bin/send-email

     # "send-mail -a" on a tuesday if monday was a holiday.
     # But only on the first hour of the day.
     # M H d m w    user
     5 0 * * tue  root  /usr/local/bin/holiday.sh -d $(date --date=yesterday +\%F) && /usr/local/bin/send-email -a

    Example holiday files

    # /projects/mgmt4/data/tid-closed.txt # Days when CS is not open. The
    cron jobs will assume Sat and Sun are # not work days, so this file is
    for the holiday exceptions. ...........TBD

    # /projects/mgmt4/data/tid-maintenance.txt ............TBD

ENVIRONMENT
    cHolidayFile - This env. var. can contain a list of file name paths of
    multiple holiday files. Default: /usr/local/etc/holidays.txt

FILES
    Format of holiday file (YYYY must be at the very beginning of lines):

            # comment (the full line will be ignored)
            YYYY-MM-DD Any text following
            YYYY-MM-DD [TAG] Any text following
            YYYY-MM-DD [TAG] [TAG] Any text following
            YYYY-MM-DD {SH-EH} Any text following
            YYYY-MM-DD {SH-EH} [TAG] Any text following

    [TAG] is optional. The record will only be included if a -w TAG matches,
    one or more of the [TAG] words. If there is no [TAG], then the record
    will be used.

    {SH-EH} is optional. If the current time (or the -t TIME) is between
    hours SH and EH (inclusive), and the date record's date matches the -d
    option, then then this will be a match, so a 0 would be returned. The SH
    and EH hours are in 24 hour format, with leading zero.
