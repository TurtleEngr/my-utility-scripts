NAME logit
    Keep a log of your activity.

SYNOPSIS
            logit           # usage help
            logit -h        # long help

            logit [-d pDir] [-s "pDate"] [start|begin] [pText]
            logit [-d pDir] [-s "pDate"] [stop|done|end|finish] [pText]
            logit [-d pDir] [-s "pDate"] pText

            logit -m        # merge log files
            logit -r        # report (after merge)

DESCRIPTION
    logit is a simpler version of logtime. It will log pText to logtime.csv.
    The first "word" of pText will be looked at to see if the log is a start
    or stop. The word will be normalized to only be a lower case start/stop.

OPTIONS
    -d pDir
        log to pDir/logtime.csv. Can also be set with env.var gpLogDate
        Default: $PWD

    -s pDate
        Change the date/time pDate. This is useful if you forgot to enter a
        start time. Default: now

    -m  Merge all the logtime.csv files found in current dir and below. The
        lines will be sorted and duplicates removed. The output will be
        saved in $PWD/logtime.csv

    -r  Output a summary report. There needs to be an equal number of
        "start" an "stop" logs.

        Report output format:

                ,Text
                ElapsedTime,StartText,StopText

    -h  This help.

RETURN VALUE
     0  - OK
     !0 - problem

EXAMPLES
            cd project/beach
            logit start project
            # Creates: project/beach/logtime.csv

            cd project/beach/edit
            # Run editor
            logit fixed format
            # Creates: project/beach/edit/logtime.csv

            cd ../render
            # Add forgotten start time:
            logit -s 7:00pm start editing
            # Creates: project/beach/render/logtime.csv
            logit stop editing
            logit start rendering
            sleep 300
            logit stop  rendering
            logit stop project

            cd ..
            logit -m
            # Creates: project/beach/logtime.csv
            # Merges: project/beach/logtime.csv,
            # project/beach/edit/logtime.csv,
            # project/beach/render/logtime.csv

            logit -r

ENVIRONMENT
            gpLogDate=${$gpLogDate:-now}    # -s
            gpLogDir=${gpLogDir:-$PWD}      # -d
            gpLogFile=${gpLogFile:-logtime.csv}

FILES
            logtime.csv

  Format of logtime.csv
            YYYY-MM-DD,HH:MM:SS,TZ,Sec,Host,PWD,pText
            1          2        3  4   5    6   7

SEE ALSO
            logtime
            timelog.sh

NOTES
    logit is designed so that you can run it in any directory. It is simpler
    than the "logtime" script, which tries to find a "top" logtime.csv file

    For the report, if another 'start' is seen before a 'stop', then that
    start's time will be used as and implied stop.

    If a 'stop' is seen, but there was not 'start', then the time of the
    last log message will be used for an implied start.
