NAME
    gpgagent - setup the gpg and ssh agent process

SYNOPSIS
     . gpgagent [-h] [-a] [-s] [-k] [key ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gpgagent is a wrapper for gpg-agent, ssh-add, and gpg. Notice that the
    script is "sourced" (.) so that the env. var. are defined.

    If there are no option flags, any running agents owned by you (or the
    $cgAgentOwner) are killed, and a new agent is started, adding any of the
    keys passed.

    For the best use of gpgagent, put your public keys in the
    ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on all the systems that you have login
    access to.

    If the directory /home/$cgAgentOwner/.gnupg is group or other read or
    writable, gpgagent will exit with an error

OPTIONS
    -h  This help.

    -a  Connect to the existing agent, and add the passed keys.

    -s  Only set env. var. (don't run a new agent). Fails if there is no
        .gpg-agent-info file.

    -k  Kill all agents owned by you, and remove the .gpg-agent-info file.

    key...
        A list of key file names and/or gpg keys. Keys with a '@' in them
        will be treated as gpg keys. All other keys will be treated as ssh
        private key files.

RETURN VALUE
ERRORS
EXAMPLES
    In a profile script:

            . gpgagent ~/.ssh/id.home ~/.ssh/id.work

    In a script run by the 'root' user:

            export $cgAgentOwner=george
            . gpgagent -s

    You ran gpgagent manually to create an agent, but you forgot to "source"
    the script so that the SSH_* env. are set. Fix this by just running
    gpgagent with the -s option:

            . gpgagent -s

    Add another ssh key to a running agent:

            gpgagent -a ~/.ssh/id_foo_dsa

    Add another gpg key to a running agent:

            gpgagent -a joe@yahoo.com

    List agent and added keys:

            ssh-add -l

    Kill all agents:

            gpgagent -k

ENVIRONMENT
     $cgAgentOwner - user name.  Set to $LOGNAME if empty.

     $GPG_AGENT_INFO - set by gpgagent
     $SSH_AUTH_SOCK - set by gpgagent
     $SSH_AGENT_PID - set by gpgagent

FILES
     /home/$cgAgentOwner/.gnupg/.gpg-agent-info
     $HOME/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

SEE ALSO
     gpg-agent, gpg, ssh-add, pinentry-qt

NOTES
    Because this script is usually sourced, exits and functions are not
    used. So that is why the "if" logic in this script is so messy with the
    pExit flag.

CAVEATS
DIAGNOSTICS
BUGS
RESTRICTIONS
    gpgagent only works well with bash.
