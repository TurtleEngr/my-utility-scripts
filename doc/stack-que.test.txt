NAME
        stack-que.inc  - bash stack and queue functions
        stack-que.test - test the stack and queue functions

SYNOPSIS
        ./stack-que.test -h - full help

        fsqNew [pName]
        fsqPush pElement [pName]
        fsqPop [pName]
            See: sqReturn
        fsqSize [pName]
            See: sqReturn
        fsqClear [pName]
        fsqExists [pName]

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple implemention of a stack (FILO) and queue (FIFO).

    To see this usage text formatted, run:

        ./stack-que.test -h

  fsqNew pType [pName]
    This must be called before any of the other fsq functions.

    if pType is "que", then push/pop will behave as a queue. Order: First In
    First Out

    if pType is "stack", then push/pop will behave as a stack. Order: Last
    In First Out

    If pName is defined, that will set the name of the que or stack. That
    way multiple queues and stacks can be used. Default: sqList

  fsqClear [pName]
    Empty the stack or queue.

  fsqPush pElement [pName]
    Push pElement into queue or stack.

        sqReturn = pElement
        Return = 0

    If there is no pElement

        sqReturn = ""
        Return = 1

  fsqPop [pName]
    Pop and element from a que or stack.

        sqReturn = first element put in queue
        Return = 0

    If there are no elements in the queue

        sqReturn = ""
        Return = 1

  sqSize [pName]
    Return the number of elements in the queue or stack.

        sqReturn = number of elements
        Return = 0

RETURN VALUE
        0 - if OK
        1 - if Error

ERRORS
    If fsqNew is not called first, then all the other functions will return
    non-zero.

EXAMPLES
        cBin=~/bin
        . $cBin/stack-que.inc

        fsqNew stack
        fsqPush one
        fsqPush two
        fsqPush three
        fsqSize
        echo $sqReturn
      3
        fsqPop
        echo $sqReturn
      three

        fsqNew que Input
        fsqPush one Input
        fsqPush two Input
        fsqPush three Input

        fsqNew que Output
        while fsqPop Input; do
            fsqPush "Processed-$sqReturn" Output
        done
        while fsqPop Output; do
            echo $sqReturn
        done
      Processed-one
      Processed-two
      Processed-three

ENVIRONMENT
    sqReturn, sqType, sqList, sq[pName]

SEE ALSO
    shunit2.1

NOTES
  Initial version
    This is what Chat-GPT generated with this input: "In bash, write queue
    management functions. Push a string, pop a string, and list the size of
    the queue."

        queue=()

        function push_string() {
          local string=$1
          queue=("${queue[@]}" "$string")
        }

        function pop_string() {
          local front=${queue[0]}
          queue=("${queue[@]:1}")
          echo $front
        }

        function list_size() {
          echo ${#queue[@]}
        }

    Nice and simple, but no error handling.

  Enhancemnts
    Make this ready for producion use.

     * Put results in sgReturn rather than echo. Makes testing easier.
     * Renamed functions and prefix with "fsq"
     * Rename global vars and prefix them with "sq"
     * Wrote tests. See stack-que.test
     * Modified fsqPush to be a stack or queue
     * Added error handling
     * Added ability to have more than one stack or queue
     * Added fsqClear, fsqExists

  To test
    shunit2.1 is used to run the unit tests for the stack-que.inc functions.

    For this help:

        ./stack-que.test

    Run tests

        ./stack-que.test all
        ./stack-que.test [testName,testName,...]

CAVEATS
    The elements to be pushed cannot contain spaces.
