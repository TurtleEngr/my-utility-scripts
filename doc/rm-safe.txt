NAME
    rm-safe - If recursive remove, first remove symlinks. Also can just mv
    files.

SYNOPSIS
    rm-safe [-f] [-r] [-R] [-m] [-l] [-i] [-v] [-x] [-h] FILES

        -f - force remove            -v - verbose
        -r,-R - recursive remove     -x - debug, do nothing
        -m - move files              -h - more help
        -l - log to syslog           FILES - one or more dirs or files
        -i - prompt before removing

DESCRIPTION
    This script's main purpose is to remove all symlinks, when the -r option
    is used. Many implementations of rm, will follow symlinks, which could
    lead to unintended removes of files outside of the expected levels.

    Most interactive rm options are not supported, because this is mainly
    for use in scripts.

    The -m option will try to move files to tmp dirs, rather than remove
    files.

  Other safety features
    * If you are cd'ed to the top / dir, rm-safe will exit with an error.
    Using wild cards while at that level could be very destructive. Double
    check what you are doing and use the standard 'rm'.

    * If you specify an absolute path, and it has less than two directory
    levels, then rm-safe will exit with an error. Double check what you are
    doing and use the standard 'rm'.

OPTIONS
    -f  Force remove. And turns off -i option.

    -r, -R
        Recursive removal. First symlinks will be removed.

    -m  Move files tmp dir. If root user use: $Tmp, or /var/tmp, or /tmp If
        not root user use: $Tmp, or $HOME/tmp, or /var/tmp, or /tmp

        The -r option is ignored.

    -l  Send log messages to syslog.

    -i  Interactive prompt for removals. This turns off the -f option.

    -h  This help.

    -v  Verbose output. Sent to stderr.

    -x  Debug mode. Do nothing. Just show what would be done. Multiple x
        options will give more debug output.

         -x - show command that would be executed
         -xx - also show the symlinks that would be removed
         -xxx - also show all internal variable options set

    FILES
        One or more directories or files.

RETURN VALUE
     0 - OK
     1 - error
